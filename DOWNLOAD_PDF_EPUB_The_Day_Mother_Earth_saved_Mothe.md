Overview
Since the beginning of my time I have spent decades admiring artists and how they are able to transmute their pain into something beautiful. Consider this just that. The pain of being a female in the military, losing a daughter, finding spirituality and being saved by God Consciousness- from a failed suicidal attempt. My pain bleeds through the aching depths of these pages hoping that it may ignite something within YOU too. - Meagan
