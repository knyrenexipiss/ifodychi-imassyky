By chance, John and Jean -- one English, the other French -- meet in a provincial railway station. Their resemblance to each other is uncanny, and they spend the next few hours talking and drinking - until at last John falls into a drunken stupor. It&amp;#039;s to be his last carefree moment, for when he wakes, Jean has stolen his identity and disappeared. So the Englishman steps into the Frenchman&amp;#039;s shoes, and faces a variety of perplexing roles - as owner of a chateau, director of a failing business, head of a fractious family, and master of nothing.
 
 Gripping and complex, The Scapegoat is a masterful exploration of doubling and identity, and of the dark side of the self.
 
 &amp;quot;A dazzlingly clever and immensely entertaining novel.&amp;quot;-New York Times
