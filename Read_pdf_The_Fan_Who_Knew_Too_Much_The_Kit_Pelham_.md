Overview
Launching a new series, a podcaster and cult science fiction superfan stages a documentary to solve her friend‚Äôs murder, and a 40-year-old disappearance, in this riotous and fiendishly twisty mystery.
 
 Perfect for fans of classic TV such as Doctor Who and Star Trek, wobbly cardboard sets and spandex costumes, and sharp-witted amateur detective crime such as Richard Osman, J. M. Hall and Andrew Cartmel.
 
 Kit Pelham is a professional fan, interviewer, host of the podcast The First Cult is the Deepest, and occasional obituary writer. Except this time the obituary is for her friend, maverick podcaster Wolf Tyler, who has been murdered in his shed during a live broadcast, moments before revealing a huge secret about the cult TV show Vixens from the Void.
 
 Kit and her group of friends and fellow superfans soon realise Wolf had discovered something about the disappearance of Lily Sparkes, an extra on Vixens from the Void, back in 1986. And it was a secret worth killing for...
 
 To find justice for their friend, and much more importantly, new trivia about their favourite TV show, the gang decide to put together a ‚ÄúThen and Now‚Äù Blu-Ray documentary that will reunite the original cast and crew. Armed with only a shoestring budget, an occasionally soggy drone, action figures (in the original packaging) and encyclopaedic knowledge of 1980s sci-fi TV, they have just four days to discover Wolf‚Äôs secret, and solve his murder.
