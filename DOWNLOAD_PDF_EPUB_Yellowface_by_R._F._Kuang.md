Overview
This Barnes &amp; Noble Exclusive Edition includes an essay from R. F. Kuang that explores Asian American identity and representation in literature, looking at racism, diversity and cultural appropriation. Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars: same year at Yale, same debut year in publishing. But Athenaâ€™s a cross-genre literary darling, and June didnâ€™t even get a paperback release. Nobody wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks. So when June witnesses Athenaâ€™s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athenaâ€™s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers to the British and French war efforts during World War I. So what if June edits Athenaâ€™s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Songâ€”complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesnâ€™t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? Thatâ€™s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree. But June canâ€™t get away from Athenaâ€™s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring Juneâ€™s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves. With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface takes on questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation not only in the publishing industry but the persistent erasure of Asian-American voices and history by Western white society. R. F. Kuangâ€™s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.
