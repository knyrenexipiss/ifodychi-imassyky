In this scathing feminist horror collection, readers will encounter ten short stories featuring ten different women with ten distinct manifestations of patriarchy-induced madness. Blending sci-fi, speculative fiction, horror, and the achingly mundane, Phoenix Mendoza explores what it means to be a woman teetering on the edge of sanity. Watch two childhood best friends develop a dangerous sex game inspired by their fathers&amp;#039; suicides. Accompany Kyrie as she visits her grandparents home, where she skinned her very first deer. Spend several delirious, hallucinatory nights with Carolyn at the train station she haunts whenever she cannot sleep. Dress a mannequin who might not be a mannequin at all. Let these madwomen invite you, one by one, into their complex interior worlds. Let them function as a mirror, a reflection of the self and of society.
